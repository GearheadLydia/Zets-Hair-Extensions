# Zetsukaze's Hair Extensions
Hehe pun intended. Created to fix the Hairs+ mod for DeadPeopleTileset. Also, the terrible formatting was bugging me :man_shrugging:

# Dependencies
Requires [DeadPeopleTileset](https://github.com/SomeDeadGuy/Cata-MSX-DeadPeopleTileset). It's a great tileset! Try it out :satisfied:

# Usage Guide
1. Copy the entire mod folder to `<CDDAInstallationFolder>\data\mods`
2. Extract the ZIPs of the mods that you play into the mod folder
3. Enable `Zetsukaze's Hair Extensions` and enjoy the variety of hairs, eyes and skins!

For example, if you play with [Cataclysm++](https://github.com/Noctifer-de-Mortem/nocts_cata_mod), then unzip the folder `Zets-Hair-Cataclysm++.zip` folder into `Zets-Hair-Extensions`. Easy right?

## Info
Based the chances roughly on US statistics, if you know any that are more accurate point me in that direction!

For the skins, they are determined after what eye colour you get, as certain eye sprites (Anime style cute eyes) go with certain skin sprites only.

# List of Supported Mods
* [Cataclysm++](https://github.com/Noctifer-de-Mortem/nocts_cata_mod)
* More Locations
* [PK's Rebalancing](https://github.com/dissociativity/PKs_Rebalancing)

### Issues
Do let me know if there are NPCs wandering around without any hair! You have to redefine the entire NPC class with the additional traits, as `"copy-from"` does not work, unfortunately, so each mod has to have their npc classes replicated. So, if any mod has updated their NPC class, do let me know so I can update as well, if not they will be missing updates.

If you want a mod added, feel free to let me know!
