# Zetsukaze's Hair Extensions
Hehe pun intended. Created to fix the Hairs+ mod for DeadPeopleTileset. Also, the terrible formatting was bugging me :man_shrugging:

# Dependencies
Requires [DeadPeopleTileset](https://github.com/SomeDeadGuy/Cata-MSX-DeadPeopleTileset). It's a great tileset! Try it out :satisfied:

# Usage Guide
1. Copy the entire mod folder to `<CDDAInstallationFolder>\data\mods`
2. Extract the ZIPs of the mods that you play into the mod folder
3. If you wish to enable *\~Kawaii\~* features, extract `Zets-Hair-Jp-Features` into the mod folder and override the existing 3 jp_*.json files
3. Enable `Zetsukaze's Hair Extensions` and enjoy the variety of hairs, eyes and skins!

For example, if you play with [Cataclysm++](https://github.com/Noctifer-de-Mortem/nocts_cata_mod), then unzip the folder `Zets-Hair-Cata-plusplus.zip` folder into `Zets-Hair-Extensions`. Easy right?

The Japanese features will still be available through debug if step 3 is not done, however they will not be available for selection for character creation.

## Info
Weighted chances of hair, eye and skin colour based on ethnicity statistics. If you have more accurate data statistics that I could use, please do share!

* [Hair and Eye Colour](http://www.gnxp.com/blog/2008/12/nlsy-blogging-eye-and-hair-color-of.php)


## List of Supported Mods
* [Cataclysm++](https://github.com/Noctifer-de-Mortem/nocts_cata_mod)
* More Locations
* [PK's Rebalancing](https://github.com/dissociativity/PKs_Rebalancing)

### Issues
Do let me know if there are NPCs wandering around without any hair! You have to redefine the entire NPC class with the additional traits, as `"copy-from"` does not work, unfortunately, so each mod has to have their npc classes replicated. So, if any mod has updated their NPC class, do let me know so I can update as well, if not they will be missing updates.

If you want a mod added, feel free to let me know!
